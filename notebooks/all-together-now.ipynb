What is left is to assemble and solve the DC system over the entire mesh. To implement the divergence on the full mesh, the stencil of $\\pm$1's must index into $\\mathbf{j}$ on the entire mesh (instead of four elements). Although this can be done in a `for-loop`, it is conceptually, and often computationally, easier to create this stencil using nested kronecker products (see notebook). The volume and area terms in the divergence get expanded to diagonal matrices, and we multiply them together to get the discrete divergence operator. The discretization of the *face* inner product can be abstracted to a function, $\\mathbf{M}_f(\\sigma^{-1})$, that completes the inner product on the entire mesh at once. The main difference when implementing this is the $\\mathbf{P}$ matrices, which must index into the entire mesh. With the necessary operators defined for both equations on the entire mesh, we are left with two discrete equations"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"iooxa":{"id":{"block":"sJbVqruTQSYOxB0ddJy2","project":"5dxSs15hZtvQDKSzFgjP","version":1}}},"source":["$$\\text{diag}(\\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{j} = \\mathbf{q}$$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"iooxa":{"id":{"block":"Ri5j4RilHBbzKiRzX0FY","project":"5dxSs15hZtvQDKSzFgjP","version":1}}},"source":["$$\\mathbf{M}_f(\\sigma^{-1}) \\mathbf{j} = \\mathbf{D}^\\top \\text{diag}(\\mathbf{v})\\phi$$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"iooxa":{"id":{"block":"m4QTgPKNkdae7mUGSaD1","project":"5dxSs15hZtvQDKSzFgjP","version":1}}},"source":["Note that now all variables are defined over the entire mesh.

Composing the finite volume system in this way allows us to move to different meshes and incorporate various types of boundary conditions that are often necessary when solving these equations in practice."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"iooxa":{"id":{"block":"zB2SIuhWZjvXh2KuacXP","project":"5dxSs15hZtvQDKSzFgjP","version":1}}},"source":["# Next up ...\n","\n","To learn more about SimPEG you can go to our website http://simpeg.xyz where you can find code, documentation, presentations, more tutorials and papers!"]}],"metadata":{"interpreter":{"hash":"28579dcce9b4c93863c7d16f93a67ba69218f1244c98cdb9f71bbf270d0a38fb"},"iooxa":{"id":{"block":"FmFHyNVEGUB6SnZ8PpyF","project":"5dxSs15hZtvQDKSzFgjP","version":4}},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.8.13 ('simpeg')","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
